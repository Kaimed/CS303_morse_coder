# CS303_morse_coder
This app implements a self-made BST to decode binary coding to english letters with spaces being the delimiter. 
It also uses a map to encode english letters to binary coding. 

I implemented a function to translate strings with a mix of morse code and english letters, but it's complexity is awful.
